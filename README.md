# Spam Email Detector

A machine learning-based Spam Email Detector that classifies emails as **spam** or **not spam** using natural language processing and classification techniques.

---

## Project Overview

This project leverages a pre-trained model and a vectorizer to detect spam emails. It provides a simple interface via a Python application (`app.py`) to predict whether an input email message is spam or not.

---

## Repository Contents

- `app.py` - Main application script to run the spam detector.
- `model.pkl` - Serialized machine learning model for spam classification.
- `vectorizer.pkl` - Serialized vectorizer used to convert text data into numerical features.
- `requirements.txt` - List of required Python packages for this project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Spam-email-detector.git
   cd Spam-email-detector
(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
.\env\Scripts\activate       # Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to input an email message and receive the spam classification.

Requirements
This project requires:

Python 3.x

Packages listed in requirements.txt, typically including:

scikit-learn

pandas

numpy

How It Works
The input email text is transformed into numerical features using the pre-trained vectorizer (vectorizer.pkl).

These features are passed to the trained machine learning model (model.pkl), which outputs the classification: spam or not spam.
